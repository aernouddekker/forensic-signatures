# Forensic Signatures - Reproducibility Requirements
# ==================================================
#
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Pinned versions from development environment (December 2025)
# These exact versions are tested and produce the manuscript results.
#
# If you encounter issues with these specific versions, the analysis
# should still work with reasonably recent versions of these packages.

# Core scientific computing
numpy==1.26.4
scipy==1.13.1
pandas==2.3.3

# Plotting
matplotlib==3.9.4

# Statistical tests
diptest==0.10.0  # Hartigan's dip test for unimodality

# LIGO data access (optional - only needed for fresh data fetch)
# Uncomment if running full pipeline from scratch
gwpy==3.0.13
gwosc>=0.7.1  # LIGO Open Science Center client

# Archive extraction
py7zr>=0.20.0  # For extracting McEwan 7z archives from Figshare

# Development/optional
# statsmodels  # Not strictly required, but useful for additional analyses

# Notes on compatibility:
# - numpy 1.x is required (numpy 2.x may have breaking changes)
# - scipy 1.10+ required for some statistical functions
# - matplotlib 3.5+ for improved styling
# - gwpy 3.0+ for LIGO data access (requires Python 3.9+)
